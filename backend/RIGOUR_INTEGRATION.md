# Rigour Consulting Backend Integration

## Overview
I have successfully extended the CineMetrics Pro backend to support Rigour Consulting services while maintaining full backwards compatibility. The backend now operates as a multi-service API platform that can serve both film analytics and professional consulting services.

## ðŸš€ What's Been Implemented

### Multi-Service Architecture
- **Service Configuration**: Environment variables control which services are enabled
- **Primary Service**: Configurable primary service for legacy endpoint handling  
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing CineMetrics Pro endpoints continue to work unchanged

### Rigour Consulting API Endpoints

#### 1. Services Catalog (`GET /api/rigour/services`)
Professional consulting services with detailed information:
- Strategic Consulting (3-6 months, Enterprise level)
- Process Optimization (1-3 months, Professional level)  
- Digital Transformation (6-12 months, Enterprise level)

Each service includes:
- Description and duration
- Category and price range
- Feature list and capabilities

#### 2. Team Management (`GET /api/rigour/team`)
Consultant team profiles including:
- Experience levels and certifications
- Specialization areas
- Availability status
- Professional bio information

#### 3. Consultation Booking (`GET /api/rigour/consultations`)
Available consultation slots and booking information:
- Available time slots by date
- Consultant availability
- Different consultation types (Initial, Strategy, Process Review)
- Pricing and duration information

#### 4. Booking Creation (`POST /api/rigour/consultations`)
Complete booking system that accepts:
- Consultation type selection
- Date and time preferences  
- Consultant selection
- Client information

Returns:
- Booking confirmation with unique ID
- Confirmation code for reference
- Meeting details and platform information
- Next steps for preparation

## ðŸ”§ Configuration Options

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Multi-Service Configuration
SERVICES_ENABLED=cinemetrics,rigour    # Which services to enable
PRIMARY_SERVICE=cinemetrics            # Primary service for legacy endpoints

# Rigour Consulting Settings
RIGOUR_APP_NAME=Rigour Consulting API
RIGOUR_APP_DESCRIPTION=Professional Consulting Services Platform  
RIGOUR_BASE_URL=https://rigourconsulting.com.au
```

## ðŸ“Š API Structure

## ðŸŽ¯ Usage Examples

### Check Available Services

curl http://localhost:5000/api
```

### Get Rigour Consulting Services  
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/rigour/services
```

### Book a Consultation
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\

      "name": "Client Name",
      "email": "client@example.com"
    }
  }' \\
  http://localhost:5000/api/rigour/consultations
```

### Access CineMetrics (Both Ways Work)

## ðŸ”„ Service Configuration Examples

### CineMetrics Pro Only
```bash
SERVICES_ENABLED=cinemetrics
PRIMARY_SERVICE=cinemetrics
RIGOUR_CONSULTING_ENABLED=false
```

### Rigour Consulting Only
```bash
SERVICES_ENABLED=rigour  
PRIMARY_SERVICE=rigour
RIGOUR_CONSULTING_ENABLED=true
```

### Both Services (Current Setup)
```bash
SERVICES_ENABLED=cinemetrics,rigour
PRIMARY_SERVICE=cinemetrics
RIGOUR_CONSULTING_ENABLED=true
```

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

The backend is now ready for Rigour Consulting integration. When you provide the specific requirements from https://rigourconsulting.com.au/, I can:

1. **Customize Service Offerings**: Adjust the services catalog to match actual offerings
2. **Integrate Real Data**: Connect to databases or external systems
3. **Add Authentication**: Implement user accounts and login systems
4. **Enhance Booking Logic**: Add calendar integration, email notifications, payment processing
5. **Customize Branding**: Update API responses to match Rigour Consulting branding

The current implementation provides a solid foundation that can be easily extended based on your specific requirements.

## ðŸŽ¬ Server Status
The server is currently running at http://localhost:5000 with both CineMetrics Pro and Rigour Consulting services enabled.
