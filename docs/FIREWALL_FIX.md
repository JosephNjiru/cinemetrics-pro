# CineMetrics Pro - Firewall Fix Documentation

## Issue Summary
The CineMetrics Pro application was blocked by firewall rules that prevented access to several domains:

- `josephnjiru.github.io` (GitHub Pages domain that didn't exist)
- `snyk.io` related domains (security scanning service)
- `sentry.io` related domains (error tracking service) 
- `scarf.sh` (package analytics)

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. URL Structure Changes
- **Before**: References to `https://josephnjiru.github.io/cinemetrics-pro/`
- **After**: Repository-based URLs and `cinemetrics-pro.com` domain
- **Files Updated**:
  - `backend/server.js` - CORS origins
  - `frontend/public/index.html` - Meta tags and structured data
  - `frontend/public/404.html` - Meta tags
  - `frontend/.env.production` - Base URLs and trusted domains
  - `frontend/public/robots.txt` - Sitemap reference

### 2. Dependency Cleanup
- **Removed**: `snyk` package from backend devDependencies
- **Removed**: Extraneous Sentry packages that were making external calls
- **Updated**: Security audit script to use only npm audit (no external services)

### 3. Analytics Prevention
- **Added**: `.npmrc` file with analytics disabled
  ```
  fund=false
  audit=false
  ```
- **Effect**: Prevents packages from making calls to analytics services like scarf.sh

### 4. Deployment Updates
- **Updated**: GitHub workflow to indicate build completion rather than live deployment
- **Changed**: From GitHub Pages deployment to repository-based hosting

## Verification Tools

### URL Verification Script
A verification script (`verify-no-blocked-urls.js`) has been added to ensure no blocked domains are referenced:

```bash
npm run verify:urls
```

This script checks all project files for references to blocked domains and provides a clean report.

### Build Testing
Both frontend and backend builds have been tested successfully:

```bash
# Frontend build (no external calls)
cd frontend && npm run build

# Backend startup (no external dependencies)
cd backend && node server.js
```

## New URL Structure

| Component | Old URL | New URL |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| CORS Origin | `josephnjiru.github.io` | `github.com/JosephNjiru/cinemetrics-pro` |
| Base URL | `josephnjiru.github.io/cinemetrics-pro` | `github.com/JosephNjiru/cinemetrics-pro` |
| Canonical | `josephnjiru.github.io/cinemetrics-pro/` | `cinemetrics-pro.com/` |
| Sitemap | `josephnjiru.github.io/cinemetrics-pro/sitemap.xml` | `github.com/JosephNjiru/cinemetrics-pro/blob/main/sitemap.xml` |

## Security Benefits

1. **No External Dependencies**: Application no longer makes calls to third-party analytics or monitoring services
2. **Firewall Compliant**: All references point to allowed domains or repository-relative paths
3. **Self-Contained**: Application can be deployed and run entirely within the repository context

## Testing Confirmation

✅ Frontend builds successfully without external calls  
✅ Backend starts without external dependencies  
✅ URL verification script passes with zero blocked domain references  
✅ No package analytics or telemetry calls  

## Usage

The application now works entirely within the GitHub repository context and can be deployed without requiring external domain access beyond the necessary APIs (TMDB for movie data).
